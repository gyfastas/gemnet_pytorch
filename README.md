# GemNet: Universal Directional Graph Neural Networks for Molecules

Reference implementation in PyTorch of the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet). You can find its original [TensorFlow 2 implementation in another repository](https://github.com/TUM-DAML/gemnet_tf). GemNet is a model for predicting the overall energy and the forces acting on the atoms of a molecule. It was proposed in the paper:

**[GemNet: Universal Directional Graph Neural Networks for Molecules](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/gemnet/)**   
by Johannes Klicpera, Florian Becker, Stephan GÃ¼nnemann   
Published at NeurIPS 2021.

## Run the code
Adjust config.yaml (or config_seml.yaml) to your needs.
This repository contains notebooks for training the model (`train.ipynb`) and for generating predictions on a molecule loaded from [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) (`predict.ipynb`). It also contains a script for training the model on a cluster with Sacred and [SEML](https://github.com/TUM-DAML/seml) (`train_seml.py`).

## Compute scaling factors
You can either use the precomputed scaling_factors (in scaling_factors.json) or compute them yourself by running fit_scaling.py. Scaling factors are used to ensure a consistent scale of activations at initialization. They are the same for all GemNet variants.

## Distributed Training with powerful command-line configs

Examples:

```
python3 -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=12312 ./main.py --config ./configs/s4169_mutation_point.yaml
```

to modify the configs:
```
python3 -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=12312 ./main.py --config ./configs/s4169_mutation_point.yaml model.num_radial=9 iter_per_epoch=100
```

Notes:

Arguments for updating the configs are separated by "=", `model.num_radial 9` would be invalid.
